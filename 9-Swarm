# Practical 9: High Availability Container Orchestration with Docker Swarm Master-Worker Setup on AWS EC2

# Initialize swarm on Manager Node
docker swarm init

# Copy and run the Manager join token on second manager
# Copy and run the Worker join token on worker nodes

# List all nodes

# Promote worker to manager
docker node promote <worker-node-id>

# Demote node
docker node demote <manager-node-id>
